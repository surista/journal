# Guitar Practice Journal - Cloud Sync Guide

## 🚨 Important: Demo Account vs Real Account

### Demo Account (demo@example.com)
- **⚠️ Data is stored locally only**
- **❌ NO cloud backup or sync**
- **💥 Clearing browser cache DELETES ALL DATA**
- **🔒 Shows "Local Only" in header**

### Real Account (Firebase Authentication)
- **✅ Data syncs to Firebase cloud**
- **☁️ Automatic backups**
- **🔄 Access from any device**
- **💚 Shows "Synced" in header**

## How to Enable Cloud Sync

### Option 1: Create a New Account
1. Log out of the demo account
2. Click "Sign Up" on the login page
3. Enter your email and password
4. Your data will now sync to the cloud automatically

### Option 2: Use Existing Google/Email Account
1. Log out of the demo account
2. Click "Sign In" on the login page
3. Use your real email and password
4. Firebase will create an account if it doesn't exist

## Migrating from Demo to Real Account

Currently, there's no automatic migration. To preserve your data:

1. **Before logging out of demo account:**
   - Take screenshots of your goals, repertoire, and stats
   - Note down important practice sessions

2. **After creating real account:**
   - Manually re-enter your data
   - All future data will be safely synced

## Checking Your Sync Status

Look at the header in your app:
- **🔒 Local Only** = Demo account (no sync)
- **☁️ Synced** = Real account (data is safe)

## Troubleshooting

### "I cleared my cache and lost everything!"
If you were using the demo account, unfortunately the data is gone. Demo accounts don't sync to the cloud.

### "How do I know if my data is syncing?"
Check the header for the sync status indicator. Real accounts show "☁️ Synced".

### "Can I convert my demo account to a real account?"
No, demo accounts are local-only. You need to create a new account with a real email address.

## Best Practices

1. **Always use a real account** for actual practice tracking
2. **Use demo account only** for testing the app
3. **Check sync status** in the header regularly
4. **Don't clear browser data** if using demo account
